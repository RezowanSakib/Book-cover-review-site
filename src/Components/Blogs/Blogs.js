      <h2> What is Semantic tag?</h2>
      <p>
        Semantic HTML elements are those that clearly describe their meaning in
        a human- and machine-readable way. Elements such as 'header' , footer
        and article are all considered semantic because they accurately describe
        the purpose of the element and the type of content that is inside them
